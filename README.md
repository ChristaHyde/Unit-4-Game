Homework Assignment #4
 

1. The player will be shown a random number at the start of my game

2. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the    player's total score 

3. My game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal
4. When they do click one, the player's score counter will go up

5. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning      of the game

6. The player loses if their score goes above the random number

7. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses

8. When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all       the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and        score counter) will reset to zero.
